            Hi, My name is Jayden Chen. I am a junior at Design Tech 
            High School and I play on their basketball and volleyball team. 
            I like to make things whether it is by using physical things or
            things online.
          </p>

          <p class="why">
            I am taking this class to gain more experience 
            in coding websites and apps. I am interested in UX/UI design and 
            I have taken some classes for both design and coding side of 
            making websites. My skills in developing websites are not as 
            strong so I hope to build that up here in this class. 
          </p>
